                <p>George Ong was born in Hong Kong and educated in England. 
                    After attending art school in Norwich, he worked as full-time assistant 
                    to David Montgomery for five years. In the late 1980s a shoot for 
                    Elle gave him the break he needed and he has been working in 
                    editorial photography ever since. Working most days from his 
                    canal-side studio in London, George is a table-top still life 
                    photographer who has contributed to the FTâ€™s How to Spend It 
                    magazine for more than a decade. Other clients include Boots, 
                    Cutler & Gross, Red Magazine, The Daily Mail, Marks & Spencer, 
                    Waitrose, Tiffany & Co and Givenchy. Early in his career George 
                    learnt that a photograph should talk to its viewer, a lesson that 
                    he continues to apply to his work today.</p>
